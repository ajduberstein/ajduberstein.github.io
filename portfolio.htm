          <p> A sample of public-facing projects produced over the last few years from <a href="https://github.com/ajduberstein">@ajduberstein</a></p>
          <p> The majority of my professional career has been as a full-stack software engineer. I enjoy using data to tell a story and have done that both professionally and avocationally. Some projects here: </p>

              <li> While working on Uber's policy team I created/co-created a number of public-facing data visualizations.

              are some examples, back when the company had reached only a mere 58 trips per second.

              <li> San Francisco's population has risen 30% since 1970, and with that has come a tremendous amount of change to the city.
              <a href="http://duberste.in/sf_growth/">I've documented that growth from a commercial perspective here</a>, with a public release of this work forthcoming.</li>
              I build a data visualization library around this concept of viewing map data over time, viewable [here](https://github.com/ajduberstein/slayer).
              <li>I've got a smorgasboard of single page projects. My most well-known is
              <a href="https://duberste.in/linkedin_generator/">my LinkedIn recruiting message generator</a>, which was featured in a Benedict Evans newsletter.
