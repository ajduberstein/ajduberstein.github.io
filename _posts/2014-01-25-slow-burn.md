[One thing I unintentionally find myself valuing in a city is quality eavesdropping](http://paulgraham.com/cities.html)&#8212;I don't think I'm alone in this.
I recall walking around Boston (Cambridge, specifically), overhearing interesting conversations 
about the existence of God between Harvard undergrads or discussions of the early stages of the Affordable Care Act.

There is quality eavesdropping almost everywhere, Cincinnati included.
It depends what topic you want to overhear. I hang out in coffeeshops
like many MacBook owners with beards and glasses in their early 20s,
mostly to get work done and to welcome the occasional interruption, which,
when I work at home, I miss.

A nursing student behind me is conversing about her theories on why people smoke
, when cigarettes are the only legal product available that kill you when used 
properly.

"Every doctor's visit, you're fine," she says. "Until one day, you're not."

She continues to talk about heart disease and stroke, two other preventable
diseases that she sees commonly. 

The human mind is tremendously capable of dealing with the immediate, but the 
more imagination required for an event, the harder time we have planning for 
it. 

I call this the Cheeseburger Conundrum. A cheeseburger will not cause a heart
attack. Two cheeseburgers will not either. However, a cheeseburger a day for
forty years will magnify one's risk. Cheeseburgers per unit time is the worry.

The Cheeseburger Conundrum bedevils every facet of decision-making where time is involved. 
Health debt is one such place, but so is financial debt. No one wakes up in the 
morning wishing to end up with credit card debt, but the [average amount of credit card
debt per household in the US is $7,117](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/average-credit-card-debt-household/).
We could extend this to academics, where nobody plans to fail out of college,
but some fraction of individuals do. People often mire themselves in realities
they do not want because we ignore these threats, which sneak below the threshold
of alarm.

I always wondered if the people I knew who were really great long-term planners
also had vivid visions of how the future could be.
