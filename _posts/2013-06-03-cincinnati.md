Cincinnati is my new place of residence. It has some unique features:

1. ##[It's home to the largest subway system that never was.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Subway)
There's an extensive subway system under the city that was never used.
Its construction unforeseeably costly after World War I increased the prices of materials,
and inception of the Great Depression in 1929 meant there were more nails in the coffin
of the idea than its trackbed. Nick Clooney, best known as George's Brother, 
proposed making part of the system into an underground mall, but his insurers
weren't keen.
2. ##[There are ten Fortune 500 companies in the area.](http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/money/business_news/fortune-500-list-has-ten-companies-from-greater-cincinnati)
That's more than Columbus or the entire states of Indiana and Kentucky. It seems that 
being located on the Ohio River and adjacent to many pig farms is what started the place
off. Indeed, Procter and Gamble created soap from lard and could ship it using the Ohio
River. Kroger's founding and success probably has much to do with its adjacency to P&amp;G,
agriculture, and waterways.
3. ##The city is covered in Italian lizards.
Among the more unsettling truths about Cincinnati, there are lizards everywhere.

As I run the streets, four-inch long sunbathing reptiles scurry off the sidewalk. If
small lizards and weird traffic are the worst of this city, I'll deal.
I do propose the tourism motto, "Welcome to Cincinnati, where dreams do come true, 
especially if you're a nine-year-old boy who loves lizards."
