This is a list of fun facts from the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) and grocery retail industry, where I consulted over the past year:

1. **Cat owners are ludicrous.** A five-for-five (five things for five dollars) deal is not uncommon in many consumer-facing industries. The only place I know that a 40-for-40 deal succeeds is in cans of wet cat food.
I'm tempted to say that *cat-owners spend money on their felines fur-vently*, and I apologize for this.

2. **You can accurately predict one's income based on the fat content of their milk.** The two are inversely 
correlated&#8212;as the milk fat decreases, yearly income increases. Whole milk is associated
with households that make less than $30,000 annually, whereas skim purchases suggest a household makes in excess of $90,000. 
This is a great example of a tiny amount of data containing a great deal of information, like                               the conversational use of "y'all" indicating a speaker to be more likely from Georgia than Jersey. 

3. **Paying for gas in cash is predictive of the wealth of a community**&#8212;the frequency that a customer 
buys gas in exact cash amounts (like $5, $10, or $20) is inversely correlated with a community's affluence.

4. **Corporate brands are brood parasites.** Business and biology have odd parallels. [First-mover advantage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage) applies to the sapling that gets tallest first and shades nearby foliage,
effectively stunting their growth; [second-mover advantage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-mover_advantage#Second-mover_advantage) applies to social learning, letting another take risks
and learning from their example. In grocery, corporate brands exemplify [brood parasitism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite). The textbook brood parasite is the common cuckoo.
Having read *Atlas Shrugged* (I speculate), the cuckoo hen lays her eggs in the nests of other birds and lets that bird raise her young. Corporate brands are the cuckoos of the grocery ecosystem. 
General Mills does millions of dollars in marketing for Honey Nut Cheerios. A customer goes to the store 
with the intent to purchase Honey Nut Cheerios and sees the nearby corporate brand product at a lower price point, and, often
enough for this to be a profitable move, purchases the store-brand product. The store spends no money on expensive 
marketing&#8212;the CPG has done this. This drives down the customer's price while winning the store more margin
than peddling name-brand products would.

5. Grocery stores often sell items like soda (which, with an insulin-like level of necessity to many Americans, reaches 19 out of 20 American households) at a loss in order to bring customers in the store.
