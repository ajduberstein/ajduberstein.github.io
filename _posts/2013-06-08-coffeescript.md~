*(These are really notes on the ["Meet CoffeeScript" Peepcode screencast](https://peepcode.com/products/coffeescript), which gets my ringing endorsement.)*

##Installation 
1. For OS X, use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) in Terminal. The line `brew install node` will do the trick. It took 3 minutes on my 2012 MacBook Air.
2. Node Package Manager (NPM) comes default in node-js 0.10.10.
3. Type `node --version` to find out whether it installed.
4. Install CoffeeScript with `npm install -g coffee-script`.
5. Type `coffee` &mdash; this should begin the CoffeeScript REPL.
<br/>
**Note**:
<br/>
I got this error when I did that (I'm on Mac OS 10.8.3)&mdash;
<br/>
`-bash: coffee: command not found`
<br/>
If you get this, use your favorite text editor to modify your ~/.bash_profile and include the line 
<br/>
`export PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/lib/node_modules/coffee-script/bin/:$PATH`
6. Install syntax highlighting for your favorite text editor. I'm using [vim-coffee-script](https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script).

##Compiling CoffeeScript
`coffee --compile public/js/` would compile the contents of the public/js/ directory.
The compiler is one-way: Javascript code cannot be converted back to CoffeeScript.
The command `coffee -wc .` will automatically compile all the files in the current directory and sub-directories ending in .coffee.
