I'll be attending O'Reilly Strata in February (my first trip out to Silicon Valley, and I'm elated).
I'm a big fan of the conference experience and getting to see what is state-of-the-art as well as
what is entrenched/standard-of-the-art now.

To that effect, I recently discovered that all of PyCon and Hadoop Summit place their videos online. I've included those as well as other collections of free conference videos I can find.
