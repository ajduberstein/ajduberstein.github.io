I'll be attending O'Reilly Strata in February (my first trip out to Silicon Valley, and I'm elated).
I'm a big fan of the conference experience and getting to see what is state-of-the-art as well as
what is entrenched/standard-of-the-art now.

To that effect, I recently discovered that all of PyCon and Hadoop Summit place their videos online. I've included those as well as other collections of free conference videos I can find.

[PyCon and others](http://pyvideo.org) &#8212; Python related conference videos from across the nation.

[Hadoop Summit](http://www.youtube.com/user/HadoopSummit) &#8212; Videos from the flagship Hadoop conference.

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/news/2014-02-06-first-videos/) &#8212; Web development and related content.
