I read seeking material that resonates with me. There's a lot of tripe, so it's reverse-Russian roulette, a quest for the bang amongst empty barrels.
One lucky strike, I encountered a sentence that summed up the unease I was feeling with life in the Midwest:

**"If you've never fallen on your face, odds are you haven't attempted anything worth a damn."**
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I'd made a series of familiar and safe choices in the previous year, having taken a job with a mid-sized firm that consulted for a risk-averse Fortune 500 grocery retailer. 
Grocery is a bubble-free industry&#8212;in economic troughs, shoppers may downgrade from namebrand to store-brand but likely continue to shop at your store.
My university education was equally tame. I'd gone to college close to home&8212;even though this decision was financial and not out of risk-aversion, I knew that if I felt overwhelmed I could
go home for a weekend to retreat to family and old friends.

Even my geographic path through the country lacked geometric depth. 
Raised in Dayton, I went to college in Oxford, Ohio, and took my first job in Cincinnati. I'd managed to move a roughly linear forty miles south in 23 years. 
Should no force haved acted on this vector, I'd retire somewhere in Kentucky. I needed to do edgier, both cartographically and philosophically.

Though they're most rational to take in your early twenties, I'd taken no serious risks. Being young but conservative means you've unwisely invested your time. 
Time is a levee against error: You can play riskily in your first few games of tennis and you have time to recover later in the match if you're still down. 
Money serves a similar function: When a man of Warren Buffett's wealth makes a bad investment on $20k, he can still buy you dinner for the rest of your days; 
when a recent college grad makes a bad investment on $20k, he or she risks eviction. Whether it's time or money, having plenty of either resource bestows 
the ability to correct inadequacies and battle the erroneous.

This is the best age to build intellectual capital. Since atrophy is the residue of too much consistency, consistency is to be avoided.
Distaste for a glut of the same attracted me to the programming that got me to California to start with: **I hate having to pull this report weekly...can I automate it?**

That distaste seems to be deeply Californian. Acknowledging this component of my constitution, I sought change: I shaved my head like a threadbare monk,
applied for jobs in San Francisco at companies that I adored, landed a job with a [company in San Francisco that I adore](https://www.uber.com/), 
and landed at SFO yesterday. 

Here's the message of my previous year: Whether made out of constraint or fatigue, conscious will or subliminal misguidance, decisions that expose one to nothing unusual are ultimately detrimental.
The Bay Area is a fertile crescent of change, a small, sunny stripe responsible for reshaping the world this past thirty years. I look forward to getting caught up in whatever makes it whirr.
