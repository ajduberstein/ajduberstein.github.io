For eight months now, I've been working as a software engineer at Uber, where I'd previously worked in data science. 
Since I made the switch, I get three questions frequently:

- "Do you guys get Uber credits?"
- "Are you liking engineering?"
- "You have a bachelor's in economics and are doing this&#8212;can I become a software engineer, too?"

The answers:

- Most definitely.
- Most definitely!
- See below.

## How to get a job like mine

**You may already qualify.** I studied economics, which shares a fair amount of ground with software development. Both seek efficiency, are logically rigorous, 
and necessitate understanding how a slight change stirs up a whole system. If you share a similar quantitative but non-technical background, you already have what it takes to succeed.

**Have the support of your employer.** This is an uneven mixture of luck and initiative. I approached my manager about becoming an engineer early in my career at Uber. 
Thankfully, he obliged, and we worked to find a project in engineering that would allow for the transition. Uber deserves recognition for facilitating this switch.

**Drink deep from the informational fire hose.** I underestimated what I didn't know.
I considered myself a quite good Java and Python programmer. However, programming != software engineering != computer science. 
Supporting premises: You can solve [FizzBuzz](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest) without being an ace software engineer or computer scientist.
You can design a link shortener without remembering how to implement mergesort. You can write mergesort without any actual code. Because of this discrepancy, 
production code will seem alien to a non-engineer. Analysts don't write tests for their code, use Git, or gray their hair over uptime.
Becoming proficient with version control, the art of crafting reviewable code diffs, testing, monitoring, and logging for production systems&#8212;it's a surprising volume of information to ingest.

## I want to switch. What do I do?

My concrete recommendations:

- To start as a programmer, solve Project Euler problems. Do the first fifty. This was the first recommendation given to me and arguably the most impactful.
- To start as an engineer, think of projects projects and do them. This website and my github have some examples of this. However, think of an idea&#8212;even ones without market value&#8212;and implement them. Build minesweeper, bit.ly, your own blogging platform, simply start making.
- Go through books with interview questions. Even if you're making the change internally at a supportive employer, you'll want to have a mastery of the sophomore-year-of-college level algorithms knowledge
that interviewers ask engineers. You'll be asked about these fundamentals for the next decade of your career.
- Tell your manager you interested and see if you can get the support of the business. I have a friend who couldn't do this but still wanted to work at his current employer.
He went and interviewed at two other companies and come back to his current employer with two job offers in hand. Bargaining is much easier with leverage.

Kurt Vonnegut, [to whom the title of this post is a tribute](http://mentalfloss.com/article/25401/kurt-vonnegut-how-get-job-mine-video), 
offers us this gem with trademark sardonic wit: "If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you're a one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind."
In software, this is perhaps an overwrought characterization, but the market certainly needs more compentent developers. 
The switch from non-engineer to engineer is both possible and rewarding. I encourage you to make the leap.
