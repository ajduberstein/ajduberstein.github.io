My notes from O'Reilly Strata's scikit-learn tutorial are available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ajduberstein/Strata-Notes/blob/master/scikit-learn%20Tutorial.ipynb). 

There's a lot of cool stuff I didn't cover, like using an iPython notebook as a UI for Amazon Web Services while doing parallel machine learning. 

All of speaker Oliver Grisel's notes are available [here](https://github.com/ogrisel/notebooks/). If you want to view a notebook in your browser, check out http://nbviewer.ipython.org.
